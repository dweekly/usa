# **CHAPTER VI — HOUSING, ZONING, AND URBAN DELIGHT**

*Rebuilding the American Landscape Around People, Beauty, Connection, and Freedom*

---

## **Introduction**

Housing is not merely a commodity.
It is the foundation of:

* Family stability
* Economic mobility
* Childhood development
* Community cohesion
* Labor-market flexibility
* Small business formation
* Environmental sustainability
* National productivity
* Mental health
* Fertility rates
* Regional dynamism

Yet housing in the United States is:

* Too scarce
* Too expensive
* Too segregated
* Too car-dependent
* Too bureaucratically constrained
* Too environmentally damaging
* Too hostile to families, the elderly, and people with disabilities

For most of the 20th century, America built fast, boldly, and affordably.
We housed growing families, immigrants, workers, and retirees.
Then we stopped—by choice.

This chapter reframes housing not as a local privilege or zero-sum battle, but as a **national abundance problem** whose solution unlocks prosperity and human flourishing.

We propose a revolution in:

* Zoning
* Building codes
* Streets
* Transportation
* Accessibility
* Urban form
* Permitting
* Shared public spaces
* Integration of future mobility technologies

Our goal is simple:

> **America should become the most beautiful, livable, family-friendly, human-centered, accessible, and delightful built environment in the world.**

This chapter provides the blueprint.

# **1. Zoning Is Destiny**

## **1.1 What Zoning Does**

Zoning determines:

* Who can afford to live in a community
* Whether families can stay near schools and jobs
* Whether children walk or are chauffeured
* Whether older adults can age in place
* Whether immigrants access opportunity
* Whether small businesses open or close
* Whether cities thrive or stagnate

In most of America, zoning makes it **illegal** to build:

* Duplexes
* Triplexes
* Fourplexes
* Rowhouses
* Courtyard apartments
* ADUs
* Mixed-use buildings
* Corner stores
* Small-scale neighborhood retail

This scarcity is not natural; it is engineered.

---

## **1.2 The Problem: 75 Years of Wrong Turns**

Since the 1950s, America built:

* Suburbs where walking is nearly impossible
* Six-lane stroads where humans feel unsafe
* Vast parking lots replacing civic life
* Auto dependency as destiny
* Sprawl that isolates families and kills downtowns
* Housing scarcity near jobs, transit, and schools

The result:

* Soaring rents
* Homelessness
* Long commutes
* Traffic nightmares
* Struggling downtowns
* Social isolation
* Low fertility
* Aging in loneliness
* Schools with shrinking enrollment
* Massive environmental footprint

Zoning reform is not optional—it is essential.

---

# **2. Ending Single-Family-Only Zoning**

## **2.1 The Reform**

We propose:

> **A federal incentive structure to encourage all states and municipalities to end single-family-only zoning and allow “middle housing” everywhere.**

Middle housing includes:

* Duplexes
* Triplexes
* Fourplexes
* Townhouses
* Small courtyard apartments
* ADUs and “granny flats”

This does NOT ban single-family homes.
It bans banning other options.

---

## **2.2 Why It Works**

* Families get more options
* Young adults can live near parents
* Retirees can downsize locally
* Immigrants can access opportunity-rich areas
* Teachers, nurses, and service workers can live in the communities they serve
* Housing supply expands
* Rents stabilize
* Homelessness declines
* Commuting times fall
* Local businesses thrive
* School enrollments stabilize

---

## **2.3 Federal Levers**

We do not mandate local zoning; we **incentivize** reform:

* Tie federal transportation, infrastructure, and housing dollars to zoning outcomes
* Offer “Housing Innovation Grants” to municipalities that legalize middle housing
* Encourage state-level YIMBY reforms
* Publish national zoning and permitting dashboards ranking cities

---

# **3. Form-Based Codes: A New Regulatory Paradigm**

## **3.1 What’s Wrong with Traditional Zoning**

Traditional zoning regulates:

* Uses
* Setbacks
* Parking minimums
* Far
* Unit counts

This often produces:

* Monotony
* Incoherence
* Dead zones
* Empty parking lots
* Buildings out of scale
* Streets hostile to pedestrians

---

## **3.2 Form-Based Codes (FBCs)**

FBCs regulate:

* Building shape
* Height
* Street interaction
* Window coverage
* Active ground-floor uses
* Street trees and canopy
* Public space interface
* Pedestrian experience

Outcomes:

* More beautiful streets
* More walkable communities
* More adaptable land use
* Better accessibility
* Resilient, timeless urban forms

---

## **3.3 Implementation**

* Federal grants for FBC transition
* National Form-Based Code library
* Technical assistance teams for cities
* Pair with zoning reform for maximum impact

---

# **4. Human-First Streets**

## **4.1 The Problem with Stroads**

The “stroad” (street + road) is the worst invention in urban planning:

* Too fast for safety
* Too slow for mobility
* Harms businesses
* Destroys walkability
* Kills pedestrians and cyclists
* Generates monotony
* Expands parking demands

We propose:

> **Redesign America’s streets around people, not cars.**

---

## **4.2 Human-First Design Principles**

* Narrow vehicle lanes
* Wider sidewalks
* Protected bike lanes
* Frequent crosswalks
* Raised intersections
* Plentiful street trees
* Street-level retail
* Outdoor seating
* Architectural variety
* Slower speed limits in dense areas
* Eliminate parking minimums

---

## **4.3 Federal Levers**

* Transportation funding tied to pedestrian outcomes
* Complete Streets standards
* National guidance on safe human-first design
* Federal liability protections for cities adopting proven designs

---

# **5. Parking Reform: Ending the Hidden Tax**

## **5.1 Parking Minimums Are Land-Use Poison**

Parking minimums:

* Inflate housing costs
* Reduce walkability
* Kill small businesses
* Increase CO₂ emissions
* Waste land
* Suppress density
* Force car ownership

We propose:

* Eliminate parking minimums nationally (incentives-based)
* Encourage market-priced parking
* Support shared parking in denser areas

---

# **6. Future Mobility Integration**

## **6.1 The Future Is Multi-Modal**

We assume integration of:

* AV fleets
* Drones
* Micro-mobility (e-bikes, scooters)
* Robotic couriers
* Small electric delivery bots
* On-demand shuttles
* Vertiports (future-proof)
* Autonomous freight corridors

Cities should be designed now to absorb these safely.

---

## **6.2 Design Implications**

* Dedicated micro-mobility lanes
* AV drop-off zones
* Drone delivery corridors
* Charging infrastructure
* Vertiport zoning overlays
* Noise and privacy standards
* Street-level camera privacy rules

---

# **7. Accessibility as a First-Class Design Variable**

## **7.1 The Philosophy**

A deeply inclusive society builds for:

* Wheelchairs
* Walkers
* Strollers
* Exoskeletons
* Mobility scooters
* Blind and low-vision citizens
* Neurodiverse citizens
* Those with sensory sensitivities

Accessibility is dignity.

---

## **7.2 Policy**

* Universal design code updates
* National accessibility innovation prize
* Grants for retrofitting existing infrastructure
* Incentives for accessible ADUs
* Accessible playground standards

---

# **8. Housing Supply, Permitting & Construction Reform**

## **8.1 The Permit Bottleneck**

Permitting delays can add:

* Years to timelines
* 10–30% in costs
* Huge uncertainty
* Barriers for small developers
* Opportunities for corruption

We propose:

* Shot-clock permitting
* Predictable fee schedules
* Online permitting portals
* Third-party permit reviewers
* Appeals processes with strict timelines

---

## **8.2 Modern Construction Techniques**

* Modular construction
* Mass timber
* Factory-built housing
* ADU “pattern books”
* Pre-approved building plans
* Robotics-assisted construction

The federal government can accelerate adoption via grants and procurement.

---

# **9. Tackling Homelessness with Housing Abundance + Services**

## **9.1 The Problem**

Homelessness has complex drivers:

* Housing scarcity
* Mental illness
* Addiction
* Economic instability
* Domestic violence
* Foster system transitions

But the common factor is simple:
**Insufficient housing supply at the bottom of the market.**

---

## **9.2 The Strategy**

* Housing-first combined with treatment-first
* Legalize SROs and micro-units
* Expand supportive housing
* Ensure abundant cheap rentals
* Wraparound services for mental health and addiction
* Crisis intervention teams
* Data-sharing between agencies

---

# **10. Critiques & Responses**

## **10.1 From the Left**

**Critique:** “YIMBYism risks gentrification.”
**Response:** Scarcity causes displacement. Abundance prevents it.

**Critique:** “Federal incentives infringe on local control.”
**Response:** Local control cannot justify national-level housing shortages.

---

## **10.2 From the Right**

**Critique:** “This destroys suburban character.”
**Response:** Single-family homes remain legal. We simply remove bans on *options*.

**Critique:** “Zoning reform is social engineering.”
**Response:** The current system *is* social engineering—exclusionary and harmful.
