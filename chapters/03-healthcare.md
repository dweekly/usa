# **CHAPTER III — HEALTHCARE**

*A Universal, Humane, Innovative, and Sustainable System for a Strong America*

---

## **Introduction**

America has the world’s most expensive healthcare system—and among the poorest outcomes in the developed world.
This is not a mystery, nor the result of uniquely unhealthy citizens.
It is the predictable outcome of structural incentives and historical decisions that no longer make sense.

We spend more than any peer country.
We get worse life expectancy, worse maternal mortality, worse chronic disease outcomes, and lower access to primary care.
We trap workers in jobs because they fear losing health coverage.
We make entrepreneurs and small businesses shoulder absurd costs.
We underinvest in prevention, mental health, and chronic disease management.
We burden clinicians with administrative overhead so crushing that burnout is the expected trajectory.

This chapter lays out a **unified, evidence-driven vision** for a healthcare system that:

* Guarantees **universal baseline coverage**
* Shifts incentives toward **health, not billing codes**
* Empowers clinicians
* Enables entrepreneurship and job mobility
* Dramatically simplifies administration
* Reduces costs while improving outcomes
* Encourages innovation, research, and real-world evaluation
* Addresses mental health with the seriousness it deserves
* Centers dignity, quality, and patient autonomy

We aim for an America where:

> **Healthy citizens power a healthy society, and no one fears medical bankruptcy.**

# **1. Diagnosis: What’s Broken in U.S. Healthcare**

## **1.1 The U.S. Overpays and Underdelivers**

Key symptoms:

* We spend **~18% of GDP**, more than any country on Earth
* Life expectancy lags other rich democracies
* Maternal mortality is the highest among OECD countries
* Chronic illness rates are staggering
* Administrative costs consume **20–30%** of total spending
* Billing systems are Byzantine
* Insurance networks are opaque
* Preventive care is underutilized
* Mental health access is inconsistent and costly

See:

* OECD Health Data ([link])
* Commonwealth Fund International Health Comparisons ([link])

---

## **1.2 Administrative Waste Is a National Sickness**

Administrative overhead in U.S. healthcare is not a rounding error—it is a crisis:

* Multi-payer complexity
* Prior authorization delays
* Billing-related overhead
* Regulatory fragmentation across states and payers
* Hospital “revenue cycle management” instead of patient care
* “Coding optimization” arms races

Doctors spend nearly **2 hours on paperwork for every hour with patients** ([JAMA study link]).

A world-class system cannot function this way.

---

## **1.3 Employer-Based Healthcare Is a Dangerous Relic**

We tie healthcare to employment because:

* WW2 wage controls + employer benefits loophole
* Historical accident, not intentional design

Consequences:

* Job lock
* Entrepreneurship suppression
* Inequity for gig workers, contractors, caregivers
* SMEs competing with giant firms on benefits
* Workers terrified of switching jobs

This system was never rational.
In the 21st century, it is actively harmful.

---

## **1.4 Underinvestment in Public Health & Mental Health**

The U.S. spends disproportionately little on:

* Prevention
* Early childhood health
* Primary care
* Community health workers
* Nutrition support
* Mental health and addiction services

And it shows.

---

## **1.5 An Aging Population Without an Aging Strategy**

We are profoundly unprepared for:

* Alzheimer’s
* Multi-chronic care needs
* Long-term care
* Geriatric specialists shortages
* Caregiver shortages

Good healthcare systems anticipate demographic change.
We have not.

---

# **2. The Vision: Universal Baseline Coverage**

## **2.1 What It Means**

We propose:

> **Universal, publicly funded baseline healthcare that covers all essential medical needs for all residents.**
>
> Private insurance remains available **for additional services**, not essential survival.

This is not a UK-style NHS (government *running* hospitals).
It is closer to:

* **Australia’s Medicare + private supplements**
* **Germany’s regulated-insurer model**
* **Canada’s provincial universal care**

We create:

* A **simple**, **portable**, **comprehensive** baseline
* A floor that **everyone** stands on
* A ceiling that **private innovation** can build above

---

## **2.2 Why a Universal Baseline Is Good for Growth**

Universal baseline coverage:

* Frees workers from job lock
* Unleashes entrepreneurship (no fear of losing coverage)
* Reduces administrative waste
* Improves population health
* Makes small businesses competitive
* Encourages labor mobility
* Lowers long-term costs via early intervention

Universal healthcare is not socialism—it is capitalism with legs.

---

## **2.3 What the Baseline Covers**

* Primary care
* Preventive care
* Acute care
* Emergency services
* Chronic disease management
* Mental health
* Palliative care
* Maternal and neonatal care
* Essential pharmaceuticals
* Vaccinations

Not included in the baseline, but available via private markets:

* Elective conveniences
* Deluxe amenities
* Cosmetic procedures
* Experimental add-ons

---

# **3. Value-Based Care: Aligning Incentives with Health**

## **3.1 Fee-for-Service Is a Perverse Incentive**

When providers get paid per procedure, you get:

* More procedures
* Higher costs
* Poor coordination
* Incentives to treat, not prevent

Value-based care means:

* Providers are rewarded for **healthy patients**, not busy machines.

---

## **3.2 What Value-Based Care Looks Like**

Successful models include:

* Medicare Advantage innovations
* Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
* Kaiser Permanente model
* Iora Health (now One Medical)
* Singapore’s hybrid incentive structure

Key features:

* Capitated payments
* Outcome bonuses
* Team-based care
* Integrated primary care
* Care coordinators
* Continuous monitoring

---

## **3.3 Implementation Plan**

* Expand ACO models nationally
* Tie a portion of reimbursement to measurable outcomes
* Increase primary-care reimbursement and access
* Encourage team-based models
* Build national patient-data standards (privacy-protecting)

---

# **4. Decoupling Healthcare from Employment**

## **4.1 Why This Must Happen**

Tying healthcare to employment is:

* Bad for the economy
* Bad for entrepreneurship
* Bad for families
* Bad for workers in transition
* Bad for retirees

Universal baseline coverage automatically decouples healthcare from jobs.

---

## **4.2 Impact on Small Businesses**

Small businesses spend disproportionately more on healthcare per employee.
This creates:

* Hiring disincentives
* Lower wages
* Reduced competitiveness

Universal baseline coverage:

* Levels playing fields
* Reduces costs
* Encourages job creation

---

# **5. Mental Health as Infrastructure**

## **5.1 Mental Health Is a Pillar of National Productivity**

Untreated mental illness:

* Reduces productivity
* Increases healthcare spending
* Damages families
* Increases homelessness
* Increases incarceration
* Increases suicide

We must treat mental health as a primary system, not a secondary concern.

---

## **5.2 National Mental Health Strategy**

* Default insurance coverage
* Integrated behavioral health in primary care
* Expanded teletherapy and telepsychiatry
* Rapid-access crisis services
* School-based mental health support
* Expanded addiction treatment
* Community-based supports
* Mandatory insurance parity enforcement

---

# **6. Administrative Simplification**

## **6.1 Why Simplification Is Critical**

Simplification isn't cosmetic; it's survival.

Systems collapse under complexity:

* Providers burn out
* Hospitals collapse financially
* Patients get lost
* Billing errors proliferate
* Fraud becomes easier

We propose:

### **One Standard Claims Format**

### **One National Prior Authorization Standard**

### **One Interoperability Standard**

### **Simplified billing codes**

Healthcare is complex because incentives reward complexity.

We change the incentives.

---

## **6.2 Plan of Action**

* Federal interoperability mandate
* Legacy system modernization funds
* Ban on proprietary billing formats
* National “fast lane” for low-risk claims
* Replace prior authorization for most primary care
* Streamline FDA clinical-trial approvals with adaptive trials

---

# **7. Innovation, Research, and Clinical Trials**

## **7.1 America Must Lead in Medical Innovation**

We maintain and expand national leadership via:

* Increased NIH funding
* ARPA-H expansion
* Faster drug-development pipelines
* Real-world evidence platforms
* Federally backed biobank expansion
* Genomics infrastructure
* AI-assisted drug design
* Better incentives for antibiotics development
* Telemedicine standards

---

## **7.2 Implementation Steps**

* Simplify IRB processes
* Incentivize multi-site trials
* Create national research data-lakes (privacy-protected)
* Highly permissive environment for private-sector innovation atop the universal baseline

---

# **8. Critiques & Responses**

## **8.1 From the Left**

**Critique:** “This still allows private insurance; it’s not pure single-payer.”
**Response:** It preserves innovation and patient choice while guaranteeing universal care.

**Critique:** “Outcomes-based care risks denying treatment to high-risk patients.”
**Response:** All payment models must be risk-adjusted; this is solvable.

---

## **8.2 From the Right**

**Critique:** “Universal baseline coverage is government overreach.”
**Response:** The current system is worse—massively complex, expensive, and bureaucratic. Universal baseline simplifies the system and grows the economy.

**Critique:** “This might reduce freedom in coverage choices.”
**Response:** People retain the freedom to buy supplemental private plans; the baseline is simply a guarantee nobody falls through the floor.

**Critique:** “Government innovation is slow.”
**Response:** The system relies heavily on private innovation layered atop a public floor.
