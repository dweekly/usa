XIII — FISCAL RESILIENCE &amp; THE NATIONAL BALANCE SHEET</strong></h1>
<p><em>Paying for the Future Without Eating Our Young</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>The federal budget is where our values collide with arithmetic.</p>
<p>In the coming decades, the United States faces a triple bind:</p>
<ul>
<li>An aging population</li>
<li>Structurally rising healthcare costs</li>
<li>Interest payments that grow faster than the economy if we do
nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, federal debt held by the public is roughly the size of annual
GDP. On current trajectories, it continues rising as interest and
mandatory spending outpace revenues. There is no single magic
“debt-to-GDP ratio” at which disaster strikes—but there is a clear
difference between <strong>high-but-stable</strong> and
<strong>high-and-rising-with-no-plan</strong>.</p>
<p>This chapter is not a morality play about “austerity” vs “spend
freely.” It is a framework for <strong>fiscal resilience</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borrow boldly for investments whose payoffs we understand</li>
<li>Stop pretending we can permanently out-borrow basic math</li>
<li>Protect the most vulnerable while being honest about tradeoffs</li>
<li>Treat intergenerational fairness as a core constraint</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not pick one sacred number for “right” debt-to-GDP. Instead, we
commit to putting the national balance sheet on a <strong>clearly
sustainable path</strong>—informed by economic evidence, historical
experience, and transparent public debate.</p>
<h1 id="principles-for-a-healthy-national-balance-sheet"><strong>1.
Principles for a Healthy National Balance Sheet</strong></h1>
<h2 id="trajectory-over-magic-thresholds"><strong>1.1 Trajectory Over
Magic Thresholds</strong></h2>
<p>We reject the idea that crossing 80% or 90% debt-to-GDP automatically
triggers collapse. History and research simply do not support a single
cliff.</p>
<p>What matters is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether debt is <strong>rising faster than the economy</strong> year
after year</li>
<li>What we are <strong>buying</strong> with that debt</li>
<li>Whether interest costs are crowding out the investments that
actually make future generations richer</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Within a generation, put U.S. debt on a stable or gently
declining path relative to GDP, while preserving room to respond to
recessions, wars, and emergencies.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="invest-boldly-where-returns-are-high"><strong>1.2 Invest Boldly
Where Returns Are High</strong></h2>
<p>We are unapologetic about borrowing for investments that have strong
evidence of high social return, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early childhood and literacy</li>
<li>Universal baseline healthcare</li>
<li>Education and lifelong learning</li>
<li>Infrastructure and energy abundance</li>
<li>Research, innovation, and entrepreneurship</li>
</ul>
<p>We are far less tolerant of borrowing for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs that repeatedly fail to show results</li>
<li>Open-ended subsidies with weak justification</li>
<li>Short-term political giveaways disguised as “investments”</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Debt is justified by future value, not by vibes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="truth-telling-about-tradeoffs"><strong>1.3 Truth-Telling About
Tradeoffs</strong></h2>
<p>We will not pretend:</p>
<ul>
<li>That we can have European-style social guarantees with permanently
low U.S. tax levels</li>
<li>That “growth alone” can forever outrun demographics and health
costs</li>
<li>That every popular program can grow indefinitely with no
consequences</li>
</ul>
<p>Fiscal resilience requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honest baselines</li>
<li>Transparent assumptions</li>
<li>Clear statements of what we will not fund</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intergenerational-fairness"><strong>1.4 Intergenerational
Fairness</strong></h2>
<p>A fiscally serious country asks:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we handing to our children—assets and capabilities, or
bills and brittle systems?</li>
<li>Which commitments genuinely make future Americans more capable?</li>
<li>Which simply shift burdens onto them because we were unwilling to
face hard choices?</li>
</ul>
<p>We treat intergenerational fairness as a constraint, not an
afterthought.</p>
<h1 id="entitlements-in-a-world-of-longer-lives"><strong>2. Entitlements
in a World of Longer Lives</strong></h1>
<h2 id="universal-healthcare-as-a-baseline-not-a-perk"><strong>2.1
Universal Healthcare as a Baseline, Not a Perk</strong></h2>
<p>This platform commits to universal baseline healthcare—effectively a
Medicare-like guarantee for everyone. That is not a cut to Medicare; it
is a <strong>broadening</strong> of the promise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone should be assured reasonable medical care services</li>
<li>Coverage should not depend on employer or zip code</li>
<li>Prevention and primary care should be easy to access</li>
</ul>
<p>Financing that baseline honestly means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing that healthcare is the largest structural driver of
long-run spending</li>
<li>Designing payment and delivery systems that control costs through
efficiency and prevention, not denial of care</li>
<li>Being explicit about the revenue sources that will support this
system</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="social-security-sustainability-with-dignity"><strong>2.2 Social
Security: Sustainability With Dignity</strong></h2>
<p>Social Security is a promise: work, contribute, and you will not face
destitution in old age. Keeping that promise requires adjusting to real
morbidity and mortality data and to longer, healthier lives.</p>
<p>We are open to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradually <strong>raising the “normal” retirement age</strong>,
indexed to longevity</li>
<li>Increasing <strong>progressivity</strong> so lower lifetime earners
are protected</li>
<li>Updating disability and early-retirement rules to reflect real
physical burdens</li>
</ul>
<p>But we refuse to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balance the books solely by quietly cutting benefits for those with
the fewest options</li>
<li>Ignore the reality that life expectancy and health are
<strong>unevenly distributed</strong>—office workers and manual laborers
do not age the same way</li>
</ul>
<p>Any adjustment to retirement ages must therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include stronger protections for workers in physically demanding
jobs</li>
<li>Preserve adequate benefits for people with shorter expected
lifespans</li>
<li>Phase in slowly, with <strong>clear advance notice</strong> so
people can plan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="no-sudden-shock-for-near-retirees"><strong>2.3 No “Sudden Shock”
for Near-Retirees</strong></h2>
<p>We will not change the rules out from under people already at or near
retirement.</p>
<p>Policy changes should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply primarily to younger cohorts</li>
<li>Be phased in over decades, not years</li>
<li>Be communicated clearly, not buried in footnotes</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tax-architecture-how-we-pay-for-what-we-value"><strong>3. Tax
Architecture: How We Pay for What We Value</strong></h1>
<h2
id="prefer-income-and-capital-taxes-over-broad-consumption-taxes"><strong>3.1
Prefer Income and Capital Taxes Over Broad Consumption
Taxes</strong></h2>
<p>Sales and consumption taxes tend to be <strong>regressive</strong>
when measured against current income: lower-income households spend a
higher share of their earnings on consumption.</p>
<p>We therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer to rely primarily on <strong>income and capital
taxes</strong> for federal revenue</li>
<li>Are cautious about adding a large, broad-based national consumption
tax (like a VAT)</li>
<li>Remain open to targeted <strong>Pigouvian consumption taxes</strong>
(e.g., on pollution or clearly harmful products) when they align
incentives and improve health or environmental outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>If a future Congress considers a national consumption tax, this
platform favors designs that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offset regressivity with direct cash rebates or credits</li>
<li>Replace, rather than simply add to, other burdensome taxes on
workers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capital-income-and-labor-income"><strong>3.2 Capital Income and
Labor Income</strong></h2>
<p>Our bias is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who earn very high incomes from capital should not face
dramatically lower effective tax rates than people who earn similar
amounts from work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support narrowing the gap between top effective tax rates on capital
income and labor income</li>
<li>Favor preserving incentives for genuine risk-taking and innovation
(e.g., building new firms), not just tax arbitrage</li>
<li>Are open to reforms that:
<ul>
<li>Treat long-term capital gains more like ordinary income at very high
incomes</li>
<li>Reduce avoidance opportunities that turn labor income into lightly
taxed capital flows</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-modest-wealth-tax-as-a-backstop"><strong>3.3 A Modest Wealth
Tax as a Backstop</strong></h2>
<p>Extreme concentrations of wealth can undermine equality of
opportunity and warp political influence.</p>
<p>We support exploring a <strong>modest, high-threshold wealth
tax</strong> as a backstop, not a primary revenue engine, with design
constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applies only above a very high net-worth threshold (e.g., tens of
millions per individual)</li>
<li>Annual rate in the <strong>0.1%–0.5%</strong> range—small relative
to expected average returns</li>
<li>Coordinated with capital income and estate/inheritance taxation so
people are not double-taxed on the same base</li>
<li>Flexible for illiquid but clearly valuable holdings, with options
for deferral and installment payment</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is not to fund the entire welfare state from a small number
of families. The goal is to ensure that very large accumulations of
wealth contribute at least modestly each year to the society and
infrastructure that sustain them.</p>
<h1 id="metrics-guardrails-and-queries"><strong>4. Metrics, Guardrails,
and Queries</strong></h1>
<h2 id="metrics-for-fiscal-resilience"><strong>4.1 Metrics for Fiscal
Resilience</strong></h2>
<p>We will track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debt-to-GDP over rolling 10- and 20-year windows</li>
<li>Interest payments as a share of federal revenue</li>
<li>Primary balance (deficit before interest) over the cycle</li>
<li>Age-specific net benefit patterns (are we loading costs onto the
young?)</li>
<li>Share of federal spending going to genuine
<strong>investment</strong> vs pure consumption</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="queries-for-reflection"><strong>4.2 Queries for
Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>At the end of the day, fiscal policy is moral as well as technical.
We suggest a few questions this chapter—and future readers—should keep
asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we borrow, are we funding things our children will thank us
for—or bills they will resent?</li>
<li>If we raise retirement ages, how will we protect people whose bodies
and health simply cannot carry them that far?</li>
<li>Are we avoiding broad consumption taxes because they are unfair, or
because they are politically inconvenient—even when paired with
rebates?</li>
<li>Is a modest wealth tax here to raise meaningful revenue, or
primarily to ensure that extremely wealthy households cannot reduce
their effective tax rate near zero?</li>
<li>What would fiscal policy look like if we treated truth-telling about
costs and tradeoffs as a non-negotiable civic duty, not an optional
virtue?</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter is an early blueprint. Future revisions will tighten the
numbers, incorporate more evidence, and spell out specific parameter
choices—but the principles of <strong>resilience, fairness, and
honesty</strong> should remain.</p>
